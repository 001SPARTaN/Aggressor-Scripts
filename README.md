# aggressor_scripts
A collection of useful scripts for Cobalt Strike

This repository will contain all the aggressor scripts that I feel are useful enough to warrant making public.

For now, bloodhound.cna is a simple script to add the ability to import and run BloodHound on a target machine,
via a Beacon menu or from the Beacon console.
