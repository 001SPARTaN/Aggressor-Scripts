# aggressor_scripts
A collection of useful scripts for Cobalt Strike

This repository will contain all the aggressor scripts that I feel are useful enough to warrant making public.

**bloodhound.cna** is a simple script to add the ability to import and run BloodHound on a target machine,
via a Beacon menu or from the Beacon console.

**dcom_lateral_movement.cna** is an implementation of enigma0x3's research into code execution via DCOM.

**ElevateKit** is forked from rsmudge, and I've added right click menu options for the privilege escalation techniques included in ElevateKit.
